# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
Using leaflet.js, populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL.   Each earthquake is virtually represented by a circle and color, where a higher
magnitude will have a larger diameter.  In addtion, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.
